# API Testing Framework

## Overview

A comprehensive API testing framework for testing RESTful APIs. Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests with schema validation, authentication, and logging.

## Key Features
- Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests for Comprehensive API Testing
- Dynamic user creation with Unique email addresses and Automatic ID handling
- Secure token management via Environment variables
- Setup and Teardown fixtures for Automated resource management before and after tests
- Robust authentication handling with Dynamic token usage
- JSON schema validation for response bodies to ensure Data integrity
- Detailed logging for Request, Response, and Error information during API calls
- HTML Report Generation for test results with live logs
- Modular and Reusable test functions for Efficient testing workflows
- Easily extensible framework with New test cases or API endpoints, Including error handling for invalid inputs
- Custom hooks for managing test lifecycle events
- Markers for test categorization, allowing efficient filtering and execution based on test type
